/*
StoryFragmentListListener interface for CreateYourOwnAdventure.
The StoryFragmentListListener interface is an interface that must be
implemented by any activity using a StoryFragmentListFragment. This interface
is to ensure that the activity implements the onStoryFragmentSelected callback
function to correctly handle item selection in the ListFragment.
