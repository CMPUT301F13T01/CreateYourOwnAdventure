/*
ChoiceListListener interface for CreateYourOwnAdventure.
The ChoiceListListener interface is an interface that must be
implemented by any activity using a ChoiceListFragment. This interface
is to ensure that the activity implements the onChoiceSelected callback
function to correctly handle item selection in the ListFragment.
